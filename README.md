casper-cms
==========

Just an experimental hack for fun: do not use it in production !!

How to test ?
=============

In a cli, after install of phantomjs && casperjs

```$ mickael@root~ casperjs api.js```

Then go in a web browser (firefox, chrome or ... casperjs in another task :D)
-> http://localhost:8080/

You can access to a contact page by accessing /contact.

You should get a look to the ```api.js``` file.
